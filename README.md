# MAT: Blum's Medial Axis Theorem

This repository contains our preprint concerning an elementary proof of Blum's conjecture that the medial axis transform M(A) of an open bounded subset A of R^n is
 homotopy-isomorphic to the subset $A$. This means $M(A)$ encodes all the topology of $A$, all connectivity relations and loop relations, etc.. Lieutier gave a lengthy proof using vector fields and gradient flows, but as part of our research into singularities we believe we have found a more direct proof. This is included in the MAT.pdf file.
 
 Remark. The key topological lemma, called Lemma 5 in the document requires the max-centre map $x\mapsto m(x)$ be continuous map $m: A\to A$. We are not satisfied with our proof of the continuity of $m$. We recall some articles of V. Kapovich which included similar ideas.
